    "4. What are the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions in Python?\n",
    "<br>ANS<br>\n",
    "##### Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Concise: Lambda functions are concise and allow you to define small, simple functions in a single line of code, which can make your code more readable when the function's logic is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Inline: Lambda functions are often used inline, making them suitable for situations where you need a small function as an argument to higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Function Naming: Lambda functions are anonymous, so you don't need to come up with a name for them, which can be helpful when you have a one-off function that you don't intend to reuse elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Complexity: Lambda functions are limited to a single expression, meaning you can't include multiple statements or complex logic within them. This limitation makes them unsuitable for more extensive functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "     -  Readability: While lambda functions can make simple expressions concise, they can make code less readable when used for complex logic. Named functions with clear, descriptive names are often more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Docstrings: Lambda functions cannot have docstrings, which are used to document regular functions. Documentation is crucial for making your code understandable to others and yourself in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Reusability: Lambda functions are typically used for one-off, short-term purposes. If you need to reuse a function in multiple places in your code, it's better to define a regular function with a name and proper documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Debugging: When debugging, lambda functions can be less informative than regular functions because they lack a name and don't provide helpful tracebacks. This can make it harder to pinpoint issues in your code."
