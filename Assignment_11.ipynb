    " - Yes, we can have nested try-except blocks in Python. This means you can place one try-except block inside another to handle exceptions at different levels of your code.

    "<br>ANS<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " - In Python, you can set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes using the built-in logging module. The logging module provides a flexible and powerful way to manage and configure logging in your application. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up logging for multiple modules or classes:\n",
    " 1. Import the logging module:\n",
    " 2. Configure the logging settings:\n",
    "    You can configure the logging settings using the logging.basicConfig() function or by creating a custom logging configuration. The basic configuration sets the root logger's properties, but you can also create separate loggers for different modules or classes\n",
    " 3. Create loggers for specific modules or classes:\n",
    "    It's a good practice to create separate loggers for different parts of your application. You can do this by using the logging.getLogger(__name__) function, where __name__ is the name of the current module or class. This ensures that loggers are uniquely identified by their names.\n",
    " 4. Add log messages in your modules or classes:\n",
    "    Now, you can use the logger you created to log messages in your code:\n",
    " 5. Set up log handlers:\n",
    "    You can add log handlers to customize where log messages are sent, such as to the console or multiple log files. For example, you can add a StreamHandler to log messages to the console and a FileHandler to log messages to a file\n",
